# MongoDB $inc Operator Unexpected Behavior
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB. The `$inc` operator is used to increment or decrement a numeric field by a specified value. However, if the field is not numeric or does not exist, the operation may fail silently or produce unexpected results.

## Bug
The provided code snippet attempts to increment the `count` field by 1. However, if the `count` field does not exist or contains a non-numeric value, the `$inc` operator will not function correctly and may throw an error or modify the data unexpectedly.
